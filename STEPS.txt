Write code and create "main.py" file
besides code file , we must need to put Docker file (Dockerfile should not have any extension and its name should be "Dockerfile")
In Dockerfile we write 

#DOCKER FILE STARTS HERE

FROM ubuntu # Here we are taking pre-build ubuntu image

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install python3   # Installing python
RUN apt-get -y install python3-pip  # installing pip in order to install other required packages
RUN pip3 install pandas
RUN pip3 install -q plotly
RUN pip3 install dash
RUN pip3 install dash_core_components
RUN pip3 install dash_html_components

RUN cd opt

COPY main.py .  # copy our code file to docker image 

ENTRYPOINT python3 main.py

#DOCKER FILE ENDS HERE

After creating Dockerfile . We need to create an image of our app .

open cmd where "main.py" is present (or you can open cmd and using cd command change the directory where "main.py"  code is present)

type below code (code snippets are shown ">>")

>>docker # it will open help and gives the availble commnds to use while using docker

>>docker images # it gives the list of available images

>>docker ps  # to check if any container is running (it shows the list of running containers)

>>docker build -t image-name .   # here we build image image-name can be anything , this will be image name of our custom image after building it("." means current directory)

>>docker run image-name # to run the image in the container , while running we can give image ID instead of image-name

>>docker run -p 8050:8050 image-name # port mapping

>>docker stop image-name  # used to stop ruuning image

Pushing image to docker_hub 

>>docker tag image-name user-name/image-name

>>docker push user-name/image-name
